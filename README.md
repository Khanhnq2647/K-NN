k-Nearest-Neighbors (k-NN) is a supervised machine learning model. Supervised learning is when a model learns from data that is already labeled. A supervised learning model takes in a set of input objects and output values. The model then trains on that data to learn how to map the inputs to the desired output so it can learn to make predictions on unseen data.
k-NN models work by taking a data point and looking at the ‘k’ closest labeled data points. The data point is then assigned the label of the majority of the ‘k’ closest points.
